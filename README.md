Hi, I'm Laura Queen.

With PhD studies in climate science and a background in computer science and mathematics, I love wielding the power of statistics, observations, and climate model simulations to address challenging and important questions about climate change. My research spans the topics of river flooding, wildfire weather, water availability, and extreme weather in the realms of regional climate change detection and attribution and event attribution. Recently, I have been exploring the application of machine learning methods for the emulation of dynamical downscaling to produce ensembles of climate model simulations at the resolution needed to study local climate impacts.
