Hi, I'm Laura Queen, a climate scientist with a background in computer science and mathematics. I enjoy wielding the power of statistics, observations, and climate models to better understand the impacts and risks attributable to human-caused climate change. My research spans the topics of river flooding, wildfire weather, water availability, and extreme weather in the realms of climate change detection and attribution and future projections. 

In my current position, I am researching AI-based emulation of dynamical downscaling to produce ensembles of climate model simulations at the resolution needed to study local climate impacts.
