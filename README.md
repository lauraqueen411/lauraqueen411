ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @lauraqueen411! I'm currently a PhD student at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand, working on regional climate change detection and attribution.
I use climate models and observations to understand if, and to what extend, human-caused climate change has caused changes in the earth system.
